## Headings

To create a heading, add one to six <Kbd>#</Kbd> symbols before your heading text. The number of <Kbd>#</Kbd> you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.

```markdown showLineNumbers "A" {1-3}
# A first-level heading

## A second-level heading

### A third-level heading
```

## Styling text

You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and `.md` files.

|         Style          |      Syntax       |                 Example                  |                 Output                 |
| :--------------------: | :---------------: | :--------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------: |
|          Bold          |      `** **`      |         `**This is bold text**`          |         **This is bold text**          |
|         Italic         |       `_ _`       |       `_This text is italicized_`        |       _This text is italicized_        |
|     Strikethrough      |      `~~ ~~`      |       `~~This was mistaken text~~`       |       ~~This was mistaken text~~       |
| Bold and nested italic | `** **` and `_ _` | `**This text is _extremely_ important**` | **This text is _extremely_ important** |
|  All bold and italic   |     `**_ _**`     |    `**_All this text is important_**`    |    **_All this text is important_**    |
|       Subscript        |  `<sub> </sub>`   |  `This is a <sub>subscript</sub> text`   |  This is a <sub>subscript</sub> text   |
|      Superscript       |  `<sup> </sup>`   | `This is a <sup>superscript</sup> text`  | This is a <sup>superscript</sup> text  |
|       Underline        |  `<ins> </ins>`   | `This is an <ins>underlined</ins> text`  | This is an <ins>underlined</ins> text  |

## Quoting text

You can quote text with a <Kbd>></Kbd>.

```markdown
Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote
```

> Quoted text is indented, with a different style.

## Quoting code

You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the <Kbd keys={'command'}>E</Kbd> (Mac) or <Kbd keys={'ctrl'}>E</Kbd> (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.

```markdown
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
```

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.

````markdown
Some basic Git commands are:

```bash
git status
git add
git commit
```
````

## Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets `[ ]`, and then wrapping the URL in parentheses `( )`. You can also use the keyboard shortcut <Kbd keys={'command'}>K</Kbd> to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.

## Lists

You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with <kbd>-</kbd>, <kbd>\*</kbd>, or <kbd>+</kbd>.

```markdown
- George Washington

* John Adams

- Thomas Jefferson
```

- George Washington

* John Adams

- Thomas Jefferson

To order your list, precede each line with a number.

```markdown
1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams
```

1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams

### Nested Lists

You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

To create a nested list using the web editor on or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item until the list marker character (<Kbd>-</Kbd> or <Kbd>\*</Kbd>) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.

```markdown
1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item
```

1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item

To create a nested list in the comment editor on , which doesn't use a monospaced font, you can look at the list item immediately above the nested list and count the number of characters that appear before the content of the item. Then type that number of space characters in front of the nested list item.

In this example, you could add a nested list item under the list item `100. First list item` by indenting the nested list item a minimum of five spaces, since there are five characters (`100. `) before `First list item`.

```markdown
100. First list item
     - First nested list item
```

100. First list item
     - First nested list item

You can create multiple levels of nested lists using the same method. For example, because the first nested list item has seven characters (`␣␣␣␣␣-␣`) before the nested list content `First nested list item`, you would need to indent the second nested list item by at least two more characters (nine spaces minimum).

```markdown
100. First list item
     - First nested list item
       - Second nested list item
```

100. First list item
     - First nested list item
       - Second nested list item

For more examples, see the [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-265).

## Task lists

To create a task list, preface list items with a hyphen and space followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].

```markdown
- [x] #739
- [ ] https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/740
- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete 🎉
```

- [x] #739
- [ ] https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/740
- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete 🎉

## Paragraphs

You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.

## Footnotes

{/* FIXME: Ref Miss Hit */}

You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax:

```mdx
Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

[^1]: My reference.

[^2]:
    To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with 2 spaces.
    This is a second line.
```

The footnote will render like this:

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].

[^1]: My reference.

[^2]:
    To add line breaks within a footnote, prefix new lines with 2 spaces.
    This is a second line.

> The position of a footnote in your Markdown does not influence where the footnote will be rendered. You can write a footnote right after your reference to the footnote, and the footnote will still render at the bottom of the Markdown. Footnotes are not supported in wikis.

## Alerts

{/* FIXME: Use NextUI Instead or Else */}

Alerts are a Markdown extension based on the blockquote syntax that you can use to emphasize critical information. On, they are displayed with distinctive colors and icons to indicate the significance of the content.

Use alerts only when they are crucial for user success and limit them to one or two per article to prevent overloading the reader. Additionally, you should avoid placing alerts consecutively. Alerts cannot be nested within other elements.

To add an alert, use a special blockquote line specifying the alert type, followed by the alert information in a standard blockquote. Five types of alerts are available:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.
```

## Hiding content with comments

You can tell to hide content from the rendered Markdown by placing the content in an HTML comment.

```mdx
{/* This content will not appear in the rendered Markdown */}
```

Result:

{/* This content will not appear in the rendered Markdown */}

Yes, the content is hidden.

## Ignoring Markdown formatting

You can tell to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using <kbd>\\</kbd> before the Markdown character.

```markdown
Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.
```

Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.

For more information on backslashes, see Daring Fireball's "[Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#backslash)."

> The Markdown formatting will not be ignored in the title of an issue or a pull request.
